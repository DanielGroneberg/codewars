    "The Hall\n",
    "\n",
    "You are a servant in The Great Hall of Ghosts. The purpose of this hall is to hold the Day of Passing ceremony in honor of the deceased members of your society. The hall was carved directly out of the mountain rock to house a majestic square Grand Table surrounded by twelve magnificent seats. Each corner of the hall is adorned by one of the four Culturally Significant Features. Going clockwise around the table, they are; a comforting arrangement of earthenware holding exotic plants in lucious soil, a natural waterfall of gentle sounds and sweet moisture, a roaring fireplace of tremendous warmth, and a breezy windowsill open to the freshest of air.\n",

    "\n",
    "Every morning, The Elders give you a List of the Dead representing people who throughout the past had died on that date, although a person's name is only included on the list if living members of society have made any donations in their name for this year.\n",
    "    \n",
    "**Your Task**\n",
    "\n",
    "The obligation in service to which you are assigned in the Great Hall is to set out the places in preparation for the ceremonial dinner at the Grand Table every evening, and the most important part of this task is to figure out exactly which ghosts should sit at which seats amongst the twelve!\n",
    "\n",
    "The seating arrangement will be based on the order in which they appear on your list and the most favored Culturally Significant Feature of each particular ghost. Their favorite feature is devised by using the initial letter of their name and the Four Ancient Names of the corner features:\n",
    "\n",
    "    they favor Earthenware if their first initial is one of the letters in the name \"QUTHCRDMZ\"\n",
    "    they favor Waterfall if their first initial is one of the letters in the name \"WEVOXING\"\n",
    "    they favor Fireplace if their first initial is one of the letters in the name \"JFABKPLY\"\n",
    "    they favor Windowsill if their first initial is one of the letters in the name \"SSSSSSSSS\"\n",
    "\n",
    "For the names on the list, one at a time, they each get an opportunity to be seated as close as possible to the corner they desire the most. Whenever there are two seats that are equidistant from the preferred corner seat, the ghost will always take the seat which is counter-clockwise to that corner.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the table gradually fills up, those later on the list will have fewer and notably less attractive seating options from which to choose.\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on how many names made the list this year, there will often be days when there are too many ghosts to be seated, and only the first twelve can be seated. On other days there could be a number of empty seats if there were fewer applicants. In this case, those empty seats should be represented by a string of five underscores (\"_____\") in lieu of the name of a ghost.\n",

    "\n",
    "The first name on the list is Yojne. Because their name starts with the letter Y, they are of the JFABKPLY clan and therefore want to sit as close as possible to the Fireplace. As the table is completely empty, they will get their first choice, and be assigned to Seat 7:\n",
